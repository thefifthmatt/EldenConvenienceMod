This mod is an installer for these minor convenience mods. It also includes a version with all of these pre-installed.

- Unlock all maps
- Unlock all icons
- Remove invasion requirement for Varré quest
- Don't show tutorials
- Don't award achievements
- Additional sell menus
- Additional weapon upgrade menus
- Skip Siofra and Nokron flame pillar puzzles

These mods can be uninstalled, too. They will no longer take effect once uninstalled, with the exception of map unlocks, which are permanent for a playthrough.

This installer is intended to work on top of any other ModEngine-based mod, and for any version of Elden Ring. Remember to back up your save file before using ModEngine, and restore your pre-mod save file before going back online.

**You may include these edits in other mods if you credit this mod.**

**However, do not create mods which consist only of these edits and nothing else. Please just direct people towards this mod in that case.**

## Installation

### 1. Download

Select a version of EldenConvenienceMod to download based on which mods you want to use.

If you want to select mods individually, edit an existing mod folder, or presets have not yet been updated for the latest version of Elden Ring, use the custom version. Otherwise, use a preset.

Extract the zip file using 7zip or a similar tool.

### 2. Set up Mod Engine

Download the latest version of [Mod Engine 2](https://github.com/soulsmods/ModEngine2/releases).

To use a preset, either place its contents into the existing `mod` folder, or edit `config_eldenring.toml` so that `path` matches the intended mod directory. With the first approach, the `mod` directory should look [like this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/936393685585780846/971195691206574140/unknown.png).

### 3. Customize

Skip this step if you're using a preset.

If you have an existing mod folder, run EldenConvenienceMod.exe and select the directory where you wish to install the mods. You can select individual mods to install and click "Install selected" to install them.

### 4. Run the game

When using Mod Engine, use `launchmod_eldenring.bat` to launch the game. Do **not** use `modengine2_launcher.exe` directly, and do not launch the game from Steam.

If the launcher immediately closes, it is because the game location cannot be determined from Steam. Make sure Steam is running, and if necessary, change your Elden Ring install location to match the drive Steam is installed on.

### 5. Uninstall

If you used the mod standalone, edit `config_eldenring.toml` or delete the diectory to stop using the mod.

Otherwise, use EldenConvenienceMod.exe to uninstall mods. This will only work if they were originally installed using the installer.

Warning: if you loaded into a save file while using this mod, do not go back online without deleting the save file or restoring a pre-mod save file backup.

If you have ideas for convenience mods to implement, please suggest them. Keep in mind these mods are meant to skip busywork, not allow the player to make more progress than would otherwise be easily possible.
